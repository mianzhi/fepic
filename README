fepic is a 3-D finite element particle-in-cell simulation code for rarefied plasma.

  * fepic is designed for electrostatic problems, and does not intend to solve the full Maxwell
    equations.
  * fepic uses grid generated by GMSH, and writes output files compatible with Paraview.
  * Particle stepping in fepic is parallelized with MPI.
  * fepic depends on libfosolvers (https://github.com/mianzhi/fosolvers), which is pulled
    automatically by cmake during building.

Future development will focus on adding these features:

  * MCC and CEX reactions
  * more useful particle boundary conditions
  * more simple electron models
  * steady and/or quasi-steady magnetic field
  * 2nd order tetrahedron
  * (etc.)

Feedback is welcomed. Thanks and have fun hacking.
